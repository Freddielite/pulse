# Pulse: Handover

Uptime, SSL/domain expiry, and keep-alive monitoring for your own apps and APIs.
Backend: Node/Express + Postgres, deploys to Render.
Frontend: React/Vite, deploys to Vercel.

## The one thing that actually makes this work

Render's free tier spins a web service down after 15 minutes with no
inbound traffic, and spins it back up (slowly) on the next request. That
includes Pulse's own backend.

Everything in this app runs off a single endpoint: `POST /api/cron/tick`.
When it's hit, it checks every monitor that's due, records the result,
opens/closes incidents, sends alerts, and (roughly once a day per monitor)
refreshes SSL/domain expiry. Nothing runs on a timer inside the app itself
- Render's free tier can't run background timers reliably anyway, since
the process is asleep most of the time.

So: **you need an external, free scheduler hitting your own `/api/cron/tick`
every few minutes.** This does two things at once: it performs the checks,
and being an inbound request, it's also what keeps Pulse's own backend
awake. Any monitor you've set `keep_alive_target` on gets checked (and
therefore pinged, and therefore kept awake) on the same cadence.

Recommended: [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) (free, no card required).
Point it at:

```
https://your-backend.onrender.com/api/cron/tick?secret=YOUR_CRON_SECRET
```

every 5 minutes. A monitor's own `check_interval_min` still controls how
often *it* actually gets pinged (the tick endpoint skips anything not due
yet), so 5 minutes is just the polling floor. If you're using this to keep a
Render free app awake, keep that monitor's interval at 10 minutes or less;
Render sleeps at 15.

GitHub Actions' scheduled workflows are a fine alternative if you'd rather
not depend on a third-party cron site: a `schedule: cron:` step that
curls the same URL works identically.

## Environment variables

### Backend (Render)

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Yes | Render Postgres connection string |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Yes | Random string, generate your own |
| `CORS_ORIGIN` | Yes | Your Vercel frontend URL, exact match |
| `NODE_ENV` | Yes | `production` |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Recommended | Without it, `/api/cron/tick` is unauthenticated and anyone who finds the URL can trigger it |
| `SIGNUP_CODE` | Recommended | Gate signup so randoms can't create accounts on your instance |
| `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` / `VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY` | For push | Generate with `npm run gen-vapid` in `backend/` |
| `VAPID_SUBJECT` | For push | `mailto:you@example.com` |
| `SMTP_HOST` / `SMTP_PORT` / `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASS` / `SMTP_FROM` | For email | Any SMTP provider. Gmail app password, Resend, Mailgun, etc. |

### Frontend (Vercel)

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_API_URL` | Yes | Your Render backend URL + `/api`, e.g. `https://your-backend.onrender.com/api` |

## Deploying

1. **Backend on Render**: new Web Service from `backend/`, build command
   `npm install`, start command `npm start`. Add a Render Postgres instance
   and wire `DATABASE_URL` to it. Set the rest of the env vars above.
2. **Frontend on Vercel**: import `frontend/`, framework preset Vite. Set
   `VITE_API_URL`.
3. Once both are live, update `CORS_ORIGIN` on the backend to your real
   Vercel URL (not `*`) and redeploy.
4. Sign up through the deployed frontend (with your `SIGNUP_CODE` if set).
5. Set up the external cron (see above). The app does nothing without it.
6. In Settings, turn on push notifications and send yourself a test one.

## Known limitations, stated plainly

- **Domain (WHOIS) expiry is best-effort.** WHOIS response formats aren't
  standardized across registrars, so parsing relies on matching a handful
  of common field names. If a monitor's domain expiry shows "unknown," the
  lookup either failed or used a format the parser doesn't recognize -
  it's not a promise the domain never expires. SSL certificate expiry, by
  contrast, is read directly off the live TLS handshake and is reliable.
- **WHOIS needs outbound TCP on port 43.** Most hosts allow this, but
  it's not universal. If every domain expiry check fails on your Render
  instance, this is the first thing to check.
- **The 15-second check timeout** applies to every HTTP check. A
  legitimately slow endpoint that takes longer than that will be recorded
  as down. Not currently configurable per-monitor.
